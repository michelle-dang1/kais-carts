## Service microservice

Created a poller to get the information from the inventory microservice. Created models for the data received from the poller, for Technicians, and for Appointments. Registered all models to the admin. Created view functions to list and create technicians and appointments as well as functions to show the details for a specific technician/appointment, to edit or update technicians/appointments, and to delete technicians/appointments. Created urls for my appointment and technician views. For the front-end portion, I created several react apps. I created one to list the appointments in the system and can cancel them or mark them as finished, one to list all appointments even if they are finished and the ability to search for a specific vehicle's service history by their vin, and created a form to create service appointments. I also created react apps for the technicians. There is one to list all of the technicians names and employee numbers, and a form to add new technicians into the system.
